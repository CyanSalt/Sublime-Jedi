# Sublime-Jedi

A Jedi syntax highlight plugin for Sublime Text/TextMate.

#### What's Jedi?

Jedi is a new template language (maybe do more such as url routing in the future)
inspired by
[Jade](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade) /
[Coffeekup](https://github.com/mauricemach/coffeekup)
and many others. It's still in beta phase but we already use it in
production (http://m.baixing.com/) for several years.

#### Sublime-Jedi

This plugin is created for Sublime Text 3.
Since it use .tmLanguage, it may support TextMate or legacy versions of Sublime Text.

*Notice: There is no guarantee that it will work in editors other than Sublime Text 3.*

#### Install (in Sublime Text)

 * Select 'Preference' -> 'Browse Packages'
 * Download **Sublime-Jedi** as .zip, or clone it to your desktop,
 then copy the folder 'Jedi' into the folder 'Package' which is open above.
 
    OR
    
 * Copy the file ['Jedi.sublime-package'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyansalt/sublime-jedi/master/Jedi.sublime-package) into 'Installed Packages' folder
 (with the same directory of the folder 'Package').
 * Restart Sublime Text.
 
#### Can I Modify It?

Of Course! And welcome any issues or pull requests.

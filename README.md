# Sublime-Jedi

A Jedi syntax highlight plugin for Sublime Text/TextMate.

**Notice: Sublime-Jedi has two versions now. New `sublime-syntax` definition is supported in the latest version of Sublime Text 3, so Sublime-Jedi's major release will not support Sublime Text 2 or TextMate in future. You can find the old package in the folder `Legacy`. The new definition has many exciting feature, e.g. inline PHP syntax, so the major release is recommended.**

This plugin is created for Sublime Text 3. You can use either major release or legacy version in Sublime Text 3.
